# Time-Series-Sales-Forecasting

<h2> Project Objective </h2>

<h3>Goal: </h3> The goal of this project was to apply various quantitative methods, (i.e. Times Series Models and Causal Models) to forecast the sales of the products available in the dataset.

- Perform time series analysis to understand the data and trends
- Use multiple forecasting models on train dataset
- Finally select the best model to run the test data

 Models covered in the notebook include:

- Seasonal Naive Model
- Holt-Winters Model (Triple Exponential Smoothing)
- ARIMA Model and Seasonal ARIMA Models
- Linear Regression Model
